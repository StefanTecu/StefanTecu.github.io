To install Java/JavaFX in order to play the game, run FootballBettingCareer.bat and go through 1), 2), 3), 4). If everything goes ok, the game should run after 4).
I made the batch portable so it should theoretically work on any Windows pc.
I also deleted all the game music and ico in order to clear up some space.
Enjoy!:)
